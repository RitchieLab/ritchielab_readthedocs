Some guidelines for contributing to our readthedocs site:

#. On our site, the `index.md` file serves as the main landing page. 

#. To edit existing and/or create new pages, go into the the `ritchielab_readthedocs/docs/` directory. 

#. The `mkdocs.yml` file is main file for the site's navigation structure. It links to all other pages. Add the filename of the new page to the `index.rst` file so it will populate on the live site.

#. Use the `ritchielab_readthedocs/images/` directory to add image files. Be sure to link the images within their respectivep pages.

#. Most importantly, don't forget to pull the latest changes from the `ritchielab_readthedocs` repository before making any changes to avoid repo conflicts!
